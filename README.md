## Gajendra-I
An 8-bit CPU simulated in CircuitVerse with a 16-bit control logic to decode and interpret the instructions and operands. The control logic has been implemented via a software controller and also via a Finite State Machine.
### Features of Gajendra-I CPU
1. Supports 16 bytes of memory(ROM)
2. Recommended 8 locations of program space and 8 locations of data space.
3. CPU has an 8 bit bus which carries both instructions and data.
4. 8 bit ALU for arithmetic operations
5. Software controller used for controlling the execution of program.
6. Also implemented FSM controller (but with fewer instructions).
7. Instructions-
● Supports instructions like CMP(compare), SWAP, MOV instructions, SHIFT
(Left/Right).
● Supports STA
● Supports add, subtract, load, etc.
● Supports JNZ.(Jump if not zero)
